        <p id="content">A chatbot or chatterbot is a software application used to conduct an on-line chat 
            conversation via text or text-to-speech, in lieu of providing direct contact with a live human 
            agent. Designed to convincingly simulate the way a human would behave as a conversational partner, 
            chatbot systems typically require continuous tuning and testing, and many in production remain 
            unable to adequately converse, while none of them can pass the standard Turing test. This website features one such chatbot developed by yours truly, called <i>Pratbot</i>. Check the <a href="about.html" id="inline-link">about</a> page for additional info.

        <p id="content">These chatbots have received the best ratings amongst all the chatbots in the 
            industry. ChatGPT is the highest ranking on this list and one of the most robust and 
            advanced chatbots we have seen. If chatbots keep progressing at the current rate, then most
            jobs will be taken over by them, just due to the sheer volumes of knowledge they have access
            to, at such quick speeds.
