            Pratbot uses keyword analysis to determine the meaning of the message entered by the user. 
            It looks for certain words in the sentences that could explain the meaning of the sentence.
            Pratbot is written in vanilla javascript and uses object-based data constructs to keep track
            of the inputs and outputs. <br>

            Unlike most chatbots, Pratbot does not use neural networks so it
            does not possess the capability to gain knowledge without altering its source code. However,
            because it uses object-based data stuctures, it is very easy to incorporate more responses into
            the code. <br>
            Pratbot has been reviewed by a small group of testers and the results can be found <a href="reviews.html" id="inline-link">here</a> <br>
